# Markdown #
---
The markdown syntax is a way of **structuring** douments and providing styling without having to use **HTML** or **Cascading Style Sheets**. The name is a play on the term *markup*, which is the process of preparing documents for printing through the process of editing and layout.

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character.

`Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.`
